Customer segmentation involves implementing data science methods to divide the customer base into smaller groups based on certain characteristics. It assists marketing managers in better understanding their customers' preferences and presenting them with better-targeted advertisements.
Cluster 1 — This cluster represents the customer_data having a high annual income as well as a high annual spend. Cluster 2 — This cluster denotes a high annual income and low yearly spend. Cluster 3 — This cluster denotes the customer_data with low annual income as well as low yearly spend of income.
Mall Customers Segmentation Project is based on customers of mall where we predict which customers has earn more money and spending high by using customer behavior and purchasing data.

Customer Segmentation using Data Science 
1.Data Collection: Gather relevant data about your customers. This can include demographic information, purchase history, website interactions and Describe the data sources (e.g., CRM, sales data, surveys) and types of data (demographic, behavioral, etc.) used in the project.. 
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and standardizing formats. Explain data cleaning and transformation steps.Handle missing values and outliers. 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to gain insights into the data. Visualize and summarize the data to understand its distribution and patterns. Visualize and summarize the data to gain insights.Identify patterns, correlations, and trends in customer behavior. 
4. Feature Selection/Engineering: Select important features or create new ones that are relevant for segmentation. This can involve dimensionality reduction techniques or creating new variables. Discuss the selection of relevant features.Explain if any new features were created. 
5. Segmentation Algorithms: Apply clustering algorithms like K-Means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN to group customers based on similarity. These algorithms help identify distinct segments within your customer base. 
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the quality of your segmentation using metrics like silhouette score, within-cluster sum of squares, or domain-specific measures. 
7. Interpretation: Interpret the results by understanding the characteristics of each segment. What sets them apart? How can they be described? 
8. Marketing Strategies: Develop tailored marketing strategies for each segment. This might include personalized promotions, product recommendations, or communication channels. 
9. Implementation: Implement the strategies and track their effectiveness. Continuously monitor and update the segments as the customer base evolves. 
10. Report and Visualization: Present the findings and strategies in a clear and concise report. Use visualizations to communicate the results effectively to stakeholders. 
11.Visualization: Visualize the customer segments using techniques like scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps. 
12. Conclusion: Summarize the key findings and their implications for the business.Reflect on the success of the project and any limitations. 
13. Future Work: Mention potential enhancements or future directions for the project (e.g., real-time segmentation, predictive modeling). 
14. References: Cite sources and references for data, algorithms, and research papers used. 
15. Appendix: Include any additional charts, graphs, or technical details for those interested in the methodology.
